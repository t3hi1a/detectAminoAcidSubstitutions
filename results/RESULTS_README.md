# Results Directory

This directory contains the output files generated by running the scripts from the LC-MS Phenotypic Variation Detector project. When you run the main script using the provided data files stored in the `data` directory, the results you see here are the expected outputs.

## Contents

The results include, but are not limited to:

- **subs.csv**: This file lists all detected amino acid substitutions, detailing the location, type of substitution, and associated intensity ratios.
- **intensity_ratio_distribution.png**: A histogram plot of the intensity ratios between peptides with and without substitutions, which helps in visualizing the distribution and prevalence of these variations across the sample.
- **sixtyTwenty.csv**: A detailed table showing the counts of each type of substitution observed in the study. This table is crucial for understanding the frequency and distribution of near-cognate and non-cognate substitutions.
- **LogSixtyTwenty.png** and **SixtyTwenty.png**: These PNG files contain graphics representing the data in `sixtyTwenty.csv`. They provide a visual summary of substitution counts, making it easier to identify patterns and trends at a glance.

## Note

Please ensure that the scripts are run with the correct parameters and that the input data files are appropriately formatted and located in the `data` directory. This ensures that the results generated are accurate and consistent with the expected outputs provided here.

For any discrepancies or issues with the generated results, please review the script settings or contact the project maintainers for support.
